# Overview

I am working on learning all the major programming languages so that I can have more options for jobs in the computer science field.

This program is esentially a simpler version of battleship. It uses a 4x4 grid that your enemy can hide their 3 ships on. Their ships are all 1x1 so they can all be sunk in 1 hit each. You keep guessing until all of the enemies ships have been sunk.

The reason I made this program was to help myself learn the java programming language.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code for this project along with the Java extension so that I could run the debugger.

I used the java language for this project since that was the language I wanted to learn.

# Future Work

* Eventually, I'd like to add in the option to play against the computer so that you can place your own ships.
* I think using a library like raylib would really make this project come to life by adding visuals to it.
* I would also like to add a player vs player gamemode so that you aren't just playing against a computer.
